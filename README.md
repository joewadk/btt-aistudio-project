# BTT AI STUDIO PROJECT
Hello! This project was made by Jawad, Yousra, Linh, and Dineshman.

# Get Started
To get started, please press f5 on your keyboard. This will open up a VSC Extension Development window. Your extension will be live on this window. Now use Ctrl+Shift+P or Command+Shift+P and run the `hello world.assurant` command. This will display as message on the lower right-hand side. That is the basic functionality from the vscode extension boiler plate. It is our job to expand upon this and continue working past this stage.
